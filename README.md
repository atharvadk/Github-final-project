# Simple Interest Calculator

A lightweight, efficient tool designed to calculate the simple interest accrued over a specific period based on a principal amount and an annual interest rate.

## Description

This project provides a straightforward implementation of the simple interest formula. It is designed to help users quickly determine the interest earned or owed without complex manual calculations.

### The Formula
The calculator uses the standard mathematical representation:

$$A = P(1 + rt)$$

Where:
* **A** = Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest)
* **P** = Principal Amount
* **r** = Annual Interest Rate (decimal)
* **t** = Time periods (years)

## Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input fields for principal, rate, and time.
* **Real-Time Calculation:** Provides instant results upon data entry.
* **Error Handling:** Validates inputs to ensure only numerical values are processed.
